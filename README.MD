Android app built with an **MVP** approach **without** RxJava or Dagger. 

Uses [Marvel Comics API](https://developer.marvel.com) as a service which contains all the information about its vast library.

What is MVP (ModelViewPresenter)?
---------------------------
- View is a layer that displays data and reacts to user actions. On Android, this could be an Activity, a Fragment, an android.view.View or a Dialog.
- Model is a data access layer such as database API or remote server API.
- Presenter is a layer that provides View with data from Model. Presenter also handles background tasks.

Most of the modern Android applications just use View-Model architecture.
Programmers are involved into fight with View complexities instead of solving business tasks.
Using only Model-View in your application you usually end up with "everything is connected with everything", which translates into harder scalability. With the MVP approach it easier to understand the role of each element, stop wasting time on boring code maintenance and use it to build awesome stuff!

## Configs & API authentication
If you wish to run your own **CI** (I'm using Travis) ensure you have the following environment variables:

* IS_ CI_JOB = true
* CI_ PRODUCTION_ENDPOINT = http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/
* CI_ PUBLIC_KEY = < YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY >
* CI_ PRIVATE_KEY = < YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY >
* CI_ ANDROID_ BUILD_ TARGET_ SDK_VERSION = 24
* CI_ ANDROID_ BUILD_ MIN_ SDK_VERSION = 17
* CI_ ANDROID_ BUILD_ TOOLS_VERSION = 24.0.0
* CI_ ANDROID_ BUILD_ SDK_VERSION = 24


To run **locally** have your private and public keys in your **gradle.properties** file (project's root folder).

* marvelProductionEndpoint = http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/
* marvelPublicKey = < YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY >
* marvelPrivateKey = < YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY >
* ANDROID_ BUILD_ TARGET_SDK_VERSION = 24
* ANDROID_ BUILD_ MIN_SDK_VERSION = 17
* ANDROID_ BUILD_ TOOLS_VERSION = 24.0.0
* ANDROID_ BUILD_ SDK_VERSION = 24

Mind the markedown spaces.
